How to run the tests automatically:
- It triggers automatically whenever any change pushed into the repo on main branch.

How to run the tests manually:
- Open Postman and right click on the collection (PetStore) then select run collection
- Select run manually and enter the desired number of iterations and delayes
   then run PetStore

Why the tests you decided to automate are the most important?

- I decided to auomate the Pet module because of:

   - High Frequency of Use: Tests for APIs that are frequently accessed ensure reliability and performance where it's most needed.

   - Core Functionality: Automating tests for APIs central to the application's operations helps catch critical bugs early.
